Bug Report: Netlify SPA Routing Issue
Date Discovered: 2025-09-11
Date Fixed: 2025-09-12
Summary:
Users experienced a 404 error when navigating directly to SPA routes on Netlify, such as /login. Refreshing or typing the URL manually caused inconsistent behavior.


Steps to Reproduce:

Deploy frontend React to Netlify.
Navigate to the homepage.
Click a link to /login.
Observe that the page loads with an error.
Refresh the page.
The browser shows 404 Not Found.
Remove /login from the URL and navigate manually.
The page loads correctly.

Observed Behavior:

Direct navigation to nested SPA routes caused 404 errors on Netlify.
Refreshing the page on the route URL also produced a 404.
Manual navigation without using link clicks worked.

Root Cause:

Netlify by default serves static files and does not automatically redirect SPA routes to index.html.
The SPA's client-side routing was not recognized by the Netlify server on direct URL access or page refresh.

Resolution:
Added _redirects configuration in netlify.toml at the root of the project:
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

This ensures that all SPA routes are redirected to index.html, allowing the React router to handle navigation client-side.
Outcome

Direct navigation to routes like /login now correctly loads the React component.
Page refresh no longer results in 404 errors.
SPA routing behavior is consistent across navigation methods.

Lessons Learned:

Always include Netlify redirects for SPA projects to ensure client-side routing works on direct access and refresh.
Test SPA deployment behavior for both link clicks and direct URL access.
